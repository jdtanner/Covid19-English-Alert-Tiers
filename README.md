# Covid19 English Alert Tiers

These files allow users to refer to standard ward and local authority names and codes to determine which COVID altert level (tier) each area falls within.

Data taken from:

- https://www.gov.uk/guidance/full-list-of-local-covid-alert-levels-by-area
- https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets/ward-to-local-authority-district-december-2019-lookup-in-the-united-kingdom

Tiers are presented both as their numerical value and their description as provided by gov.uk.

The document contains data in the format `TIER_LEVEL_DDMMYY` and `NUMERICAL_LEVEL_DDMMYY` where the date is from which the data is valid. 

**Important Notes**

Several local authority names are incorrect on the gov.uk website, and do not use the standard nomenclature (what a surprise).

Please feel free to use this file without any attribution; it is provided *as is* and will be updated when the main list on the gov.uk website is updated.
