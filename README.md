# Covid19 English Alert Tiers

This is a simple file that allows users to use standard ward and local authority names and codes to determine which COVID altert level (tier) each area falls within. An additional file is available with ward population estimates from the mid-year ONS data for 2019 for basic demographic purposes. 

Data taken from:

- https://www.gov.uk/guidance/full-list-of-local-covid-alert-levels-by-area  
- https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/datasets/ward-to-local-authority-district-december-2019-lookup-in-the-united-kingdom
- https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/datasets/wardlevelmidyearpopulationestimatesexperimental

Tiers are presented both as their numerical value and their description as provided by gov.uk.

The document contains data in the format `TIER_LEVEL_DDMMYY` and `NUMERICAL_LEVEL_DDMMYY` where the date is from which the data is valid. 

**Important Notes**

Several local authority names are incorrect on the gov.uk website, and do not use the standard nomenclature (what a surprise), and popluation data is not available for eighteen wards due to their size and privacy concerns expressed by ONS. 

Please feel free to use this file without any attribution; it is provided *as is* and will be updated when the main list on the gov.uk website is updated.
